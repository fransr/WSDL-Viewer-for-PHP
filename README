/**
 * WSDL Viewer for PHP v1.0
 * 
 * Used to get a visible overview of a WSDL service. The class will also send test requests built up according to the spec.
 * To visualize it, you can use a template with three tags to specify what should be the output:
 * <!-- definitions --> HTML here! <!-- /definitions --> 		To specify the definition list.
 * <!-- definition --> HTML here! <!-- /definition -->			To specify the single definition of an operation inside the definition list.
 * <!-- operation --> HTML here! <!-- /operation -->			To specify how the page of a single operation looks like.
 * 
 * You also have a few tags inside these pages:
 * 
 * On all pages:
 * 		#wsdl#				Link to the WSDL
 * 		#service#			PHP_SELF
 * 
 * Inside a definition:
 * 		#operation#			The operation name
 * 		#documentation#		The information from the documentation tag
 *	
 * Inside an operation:
 * 		#operation#			Same as per above.
 * 		#documentation#		Same as per above.
 * 		#request#			A test request built up from the WSDL.
 * 		#response#			A response from the service.
 * 
 * 
 * If you are using you own Web Service there are a few calls you could make before the preview of the request/response.
 * Auth
 * 		If you need to authorize with a command before you try it, you could specify this like this:
 * 		$wsdlviewer->auth(true, 'connect', array('username' => 'username', 'password' => 'password'));
 * 
 * Demo Mode
 * 		If your server supports putting all requests to demo mode (just making a response back), you could specify this aswell:
 * 		$wsdlviewer->demo(true, 'demo');
 * 
 * Example:
 * 1. Specify file, template and namespace (the targetNamespace, used for s:string / s:int etc) in the construct by WSDLViewer(array('settings' => array('file' => ..)).
 * 2. Specify functions to initiate demo/auth modes.
 * 3. Execute with ->output()
 * 
 * Missing features: 
 * Doesn't handle enum-restrictions.
 * Doesn't handle inline authorization nor SOAP-Header auth.
 * 
 * Disclaimer: The idea of this came up while integrating to E-Conomic (e-conomic.com) since they have a pretty neat documentation of their service,
 * probably using some .NET module for generating it:
 * https://www.e-conomic.com/secure/api1/EconomicWebservice.asmx
 * For the test template the look is pretty much like theirs.
